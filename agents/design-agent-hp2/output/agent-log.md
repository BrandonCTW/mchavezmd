Deployment succeeded. Here's what was done:

**Visual upgrade:** The CTA section at the bottom of `/homepage2` was enhanced from a flat solid purple background to a diagonal gradient flowing from `primary-dark` (#4A3470) through `primary` (#6B4C9A) to `secondary` (#4A9B7F). Two subtle translucent decorative circles were added as background elements for depth.

This uses both of the practice's brand colors intentionally and creates a more visually dynamic call-to-action section while maintaining the clean, professional aesthetic of the page.

Deployment succeeded.

**Visual upgrade applied:** Enhanced the service cards on `/homepage2` with two hover effects:
1. A soft brand-purple tint overlay (`bg-primary/25`) that fades in on hover - reinforcing the color identity
2. A sliding arrow (`→`) that animates into view next to the service title on hover - communicating interactivity

Both effects use CSS transitions (opacity + translate) so they're smooth and performant, complementing the existing image scale effect.

Deployment succeeded. Here's a summary of the visual upgrade applied to `/homepage2`:

**Enhancement: Interactive hover overlay on team provider photos**

- On hover, each provider photo subtly scales up (1.05x) for depth
- A branded purple gradient slides up from the bottom of the photo
- The overlay reveals the provider's credentials and specialty highlights in white text
- Uses `translate-y-full` / `translate-y-0` CSS transitions with a slight delay for a polished sequential reveal
- Consistent with the existing service card hover pattern already on the page

**Visual upgrade applied:** Added large decorative serif quote marks (`"`) as subtle background elements (10% primary color opacity) to both testimonial cards on homepage2. The marks are absolutely positioned, `overflow-hidden` clipped, and `aria-hidden` for accessibility - giving the "Patient Stories" section an editorial, premium feel while keeping content fully readable.

Deployment succeeded. The visual enhancement is live.

**Change made:** Added three branded trust badge pills to the homepage2 hero section, displayed below the CTA buttons:
- A teal-colored pill with a status dot: "Accepting New Patients"
- Two neutral pills: "Walk-ins Welcome" and "Most PPO Plans Accepted"

These factual indicators (all confirmed in SITE_FACTS.md) add immediate credibility right in the hero without disrupting the minimalist design aesthetic.
