Deployment succeeded. 

**Enhancement applied:** Added a hover image reveal effect to the 7 smaller service cards in the homepage3 bento grid. On hover, each card's corresponding service image fades in (20% opacity) with a subtle scale-down from 105% to 100%, paired with a gradient overlay from the bottom - matching the visual language of the featured Family Medicine card and making the entire services section feel cohesive and premium.

Deployment succeeded. The visual upgrade - large decorative quote marks (positioned as a background watermark using `text-[8rem]` with matching brand colors at low opacity) - has been added to both testimonial cards on homepage3. The primary-tinted mark appears on the first card and the secondary-tinted one on the second, adding visual depth that complements the bold dark design aesthetic without cluttering the content.

**Change made:** Added large decorative background numerals (`01`, `02`) to the team cards in the homepage3 Team section. The section comment had described "Bold Cards with Number Accents" but no numbers were actually rendered - this implements that editorial design intent with oversized, low-opacity numbers in each card's respective brand color (primary purple for Dr. Chavez, secondary teal for Karen Corona).

Deployment succeeded. 

**Enhancement applied:** Added three ambient glow orbs to the homepage3 hero section - a large purple orb top-right, a teal orb bottom-left, and a subtle orange orb in the center. They use heavy Tailwind blur (`blur-[100px]` to `blur-[160px]`) to create a soft aurora-like depth effect that elevates the dark hero from flat to premium-feeling, while staying desktop-only (`hidden lg:block`) to avoid performance impact on mobile.

Deployment succeeded. The enhancement added a **scrolling marquee ticker strip** between the testimonials and location sections on homepage3. It features:

- Continuously scrolling brand keywords ("Procedural Medicine", "Authentic Care", "28+ Years Experience", etc.)
- Subtle `text-white/25` styling that's visible but non-distracting
- Accent-colored diamond separators (`&#9670;`) between each phrase
- CSS `@keyframes marquee` animation at 28s loop - smooth and readable
- Consistent with the dark design language of the page (`bg-gray-900`, `border-white/5`)
