        Most agree that Men&apos;s Health refers to both the physical and mental
        problems common to and of concern to men. At M. Chavez MD, SC, we
        understand that men&apos;s anatomical and physiological gender
        differences do matter. In addition, men have a higher incidence of
        illness, increased death rates and a perceived and in many cases a lack
        of access to healthcare.

      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
        We offer preventive screening for illnesses common to men including heart
        disease, lung cancer and HIV. In addition, counseling on sexually
        transmitted diseases and disease prevention assists in keeping you out of
        the office.
